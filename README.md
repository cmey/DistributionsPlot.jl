# DistributionsPlot.jl
Plot of each distribution of the [Distributions.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl). This can help eyeball the underlying distribution of a sampled dataset by looking at side by side plots of both the sampled data and the distributions available here.

The plots are available at the associated GitHub Pages website: https://cmey.github.io/DistributionsPlot.jl

Details of the distributions are available in the [Distributions.jl documentation](https://juliastats.github.io/Distributions.jl/latest/).
